### üëã Hi there

- My research focuses on multimodal AI, with a particular emphasis on video-centric AI modeling. My research focuses on empowering AI systems to aid humans in interpreting complex video content, thereby facilitating higher-level reasoning across various applications such as sports analytics, surveillance and media-content. I am deeply interested in exploring the following three key areas for a comprehensive understanding of videos:
  - **Efficient Video Representation**: The high computational demands of video data necessitate the use of efficient techniques like keyframe selection and tokenization.
  - **Perception and Reasoning in Videos**: Understanding temporal information in video, such as frame continuity, causality, and diversity, remains a challenging problem.
  - **Multi-modal Learning**: Audio, when encoded in video streams, introduces semantic information that complements but is distinct from visual semantics.
